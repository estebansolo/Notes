## Differences between Sass, Stylus and Less

There are many css preprocessors. Among them we can find:

* `Less` is a very simple preprocessor.
* `Sass` is a very interesting and complete tool thanks to its community.
* `Stylus` is very complete and complex.

To choose the best preprocessor depends on what we want to achieve with the project. It will depend on the team and the needs we have with the project.

When we work with preprocessors the code must be compiled to transform it into css so that the html pages can understand it.
